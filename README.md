# MinidiscDurationCalc

I created a program to quickly help me with maximising the runtime on minidiscs. 

## How to Use

The program is very simple to use, simply click the browse button which will open the folder picker.

Select the folder containing the MP3 files you are wanting to copy to the disc.
It will then tell you the following information:
- Total run time of all songs 
- Percentage of a 74 minute disc 
- Percentage of a 80 minute disc
